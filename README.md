# Isometric City Builder

This project demonstrates a minimal isometric city builder game with a simple economic simulation. It is written in Python using [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/).

## Running

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python src/main.py
```

Use the number keys to select a building type:

* `1` – House (consumes food)
* `2` – Farm (produces food)

Click on the map to place buildings. Prices of resources fluctuate based on supply and demand.
